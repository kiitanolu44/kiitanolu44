- 👋 Hi, I’m Kiitan Oluwasere or @kiitanolu44 and I am currently a Data Engineer at CACI in London.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data, especially when it pertains to analytics/insights, data engineering or data science.
- ⚽️ Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy playing football, cycling and climbing.
- 🏃🏾‍♂️ I take my health and well-being seriously and frequently go to the gym/complete 20k/30k runs. Unfortunately, I never learned how to swim!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SAS and R but I am most confident with Python, SQL and Tableau at this moment in time.
- 📫 How to reach me ... on Linkedin!

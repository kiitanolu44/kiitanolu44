👋 Hi, I’m Kiitan Oluwasere (@kiitanolu44), and I have 2 years of experience working as a Data Engineer. I’m currently working at Prevail Partners, expanding my expertise in Data Engineering, Software Engineering (Backend) and cloud technologies (AWS/Azure).

👀 I’m passionate about Computer Science, with a particular focus on Data Engineering, Software Engineering and Data Science (in that order). I’m excited by the opportunities these fields present for creating innovative and impactful solutions.

⚽️ Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy playing football, cycling and climbing.

🏃🏾‍♂️ I take my health and well-being seriously and frequently go to the gym. Unfortunately, I never learned how to swim!

🌱 I’m most confident with Python, SQL, Git for version control and AWS (again, in that order). I’m also strengthening my understanding of Computer Science fundamentals.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!

👋 Hi, I’m Kiitan Oluwasere (@kiitanolu44), and I have 2 years of experience working as a Data Engineer. Currently, I’m working at Prevail Partners and expanding my expertise in software engineering, data engineering, and cloud technologies (AWS/Azure).
👀 I’m passionate about all aspects of computer science, with a particular focus on software engineering, data engineering, and cloud computing. I’m excited by the opportunities these fields present for creating innovative and impactful solutions.
⚽️ Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy playing football, cycling and climbing.
🏃🏾‍♂️ I take my health and well-being seriously and frequently go to the gym. Unfortunately, I never learned how to swim!
🌱 I am most confident with Python, SQL, Tableau, and AWS/Azure. I am also strengthening my understanding of computer science fundamentals.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!

- 👋 Hi, I’m Kiitan Oluwasere or @kiitanolu44
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data, especially when it pertains to analytics/insights, software engineering (mainly back-end development) and programming.
- ⚽️ Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy playing football and play regularly.
- 🏃🏾‍♂️ I take my health and well-being seriously and frequently go to the gym/complete 5k/10k runs. Unfortunately, I never learned how to swim!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Power BI  but I am most confident with Microsoft Excel, SQL and Tableau at this moment in time.
- 📫 How to reach me ... on Linkedin!
